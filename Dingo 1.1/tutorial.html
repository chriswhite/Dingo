						<h1>Introduction</h1>
						<h2>Current Methods</h2>
					</hgroup>
					<p>
Test-Driven Development currently dictates that the test class must comprise all the functionality and data required to
run the test.
This mandate aims to ensure that test classes remain simple and transparent to avoid mistakes in developing components
which are test classes and therefore cannot themselves be tested.
However, due to this constraint, test classes often become very large and cumbersome with extensive repetition of
trivial code required to instantiate test data.
					</p>
					<p>
Let us consider a simple component that implements a method which produces a list of the values comprised by a given
map:
					</p>
<pre><code>package com.zavazoo.dingo.example;

import java.util.LinkedList;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.Map;

public class Component {

	public static List&lt;Object&gt; values(Map&lt;String, Object&gt; map) {

		List&lt;Object&gt; list = new LinkedList&lt;Object&gt;();

		for (Map.Entry&lt;String, Object&gt; entry : map.entrySet()) {

			Object value = entry.getValue();

			list.add(value);

		}

		return list;

	}

}</code></pre>
					<p>
This component will be complemented with a test class that invokes the <strong>Component.values</strong> method with
various permutations of parameter values:
					</p>
<pre><code>package com.zavazoo.dingo.example;

import static org.hamcrest.MatcherAssert.assertThat;
import static org.hamcrest.collection.IsIterableContainingInAnyOrder.containsInAnyOrder;

import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.LinkedList;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.Map;

import junit.framework.TestCase;
import org.junit.Test;

public class ComponentTest extends TestCase {

	@Test
	public void testOneValue() {

		List&lt;Object&gt; expected = new LinkedList&lt;Object&gt;();
		expected.add("value");

		Map&lt;String, Object&gt; map = new HashMap&lt;String, Object&gt;();
		map.put("key", "value");

		List&lt;Object&gt; actual = Component.values(map);

		assertThat(actual, containsInAnyOrder(expected.toArray()));

	}

	@Test
	public void testTwoValues() {

		List&lt;Object&gt; expected = new LinkedList&lt;Object&gt;();
		expected.add("apple");
		expected.add("tomato");

		Map&lt;String, Object&gt; map = new HashMap&lt;String, Object&gt;();
		map.put("fruit", "apple");
		map.put("vegetable", "tomato");

		List&lt;Object&gt; actual = Component.values(map);

		assertThat(actual, containsInAnyOrder(expected.toArray()));

	}

}</code></pre>
					<p>
The test class above comprises 14 lines of functional code which tests only 2 permutations of parameter values invoking
a component method that itself comprises only 4 lines of functional code.
In order to test 10 permutations of parameter values, and thereby create an extensive test, the test class would
need to comprise around 100 lines of code that mostly repeats the same trivial task of creating and populating maps and
lists with test data.
					</p>
					<h3>Enter Dingo</h3>
					<p>
Dingo aims to separate the concerns of data and functionality resulting with more concise and transparent test classes,
and more concise and readable test data comprised by separate text files.
The test class produced in the previous section would be expressed using Dingo as follows: 
					</p>
<pre><code>package com.zavazoo.dingo.example;

import static org.hamcrest.MatcherAssert.assertThat;
import static org.hamcrest.collection.IsIterableContainingInAnyOrder.containsInAnyOrder;

import java.util.List;
import java.util.Map;

import junit.framework.TestCase;
import org.junit.Test;

import com.zavazoo.dingo.Dingo;
import com.zavazoo.dingo.Scenario;
import com.zavazoo.dingo.Scenarios;

public class ComponentTest extends TestCase {

	@Test
	public void testValues() {

		Scenarios scenarios = Dingo.scenarios("com/zavazoo/dingo/example/values");

		while (scenarios.more()) {

			Scenario scenario = scenarios.next();

			List&lt;Object&gt; expected = scenario.result.list();

			Map&lt;String, Object&gt; map = scenario.criteria[0].map();

			List&lt;Object&gt; actual = Component.values(map);

			assertThat(actual, containsInAnyOrder(expected.toArray()));

		}

	}

}</code></pre>
					<p>
Dingo will open the test data file that corresponds to the specified logical name, in this case
<strong>com/zavazoo/dingo/example/values</strong>, and then the test class utilises a <strong>more</strong> /
<strong>next</strong> strategy to iterate over each test scenario, where a given scenario corresponds to one line of the
test data file, and finally the test class obtains the expected result of the test, and also the criteria used to
invoke the test, using helper methods such as <strong>list()</strong> or <strong>map()</strong> exposed by
composite members of the Dingo scenario object.
					</p>
					<p>
After that the test class is free to perform whatever operations are required to carry out the test.
For example some of the criteria, associated with a given scenario, may be used to establish an environment for the test
such as connecting to and logging-in to a database.
Dingo does not place any constraint on how the scenario result or criteria are used by the test.
					</p>
					<h3>Test Scenarios</h3>
					<p>
Let us examine various excerpts from the Dingo test class defined above starting with the initial call to Dingo that
opens the test data file:
					</p>
<pre><code>Scenarios scenarios = Dingo.scenarios("com/zavazoo/dingo/example/values");</code></pre>
					<p>
This call to <strong>Dingo.scenarios</strong> will yield an abstraction over all the test scenarios associated with the
specified logical name that corresponds to a file comprising test data located under the top-level Maven project
directory named <strong>src/test/resources</strong>
					</p>
					<p>
For example the test data file located at <strong>src/test/resources/values.tsv</strong> would be associated with a
logical name of <strong>values</strong> and the test data file located at
<strong>src/test/resources/com/zavazoo/dingo/example/values.tsv</strong> would be associated with a logical name of
<strong>com/zavazoo/dingo/example/values</strong>
					</p>
					<p>
Note that the logical name does not include the file name extension of the test data file, such as <strong>tsv</strong>
or <strong>csv</strong>, because Dingo test classes are decoupled from the particular file format of the test data file.
Dingo will automatically search for test data files which match the logical name regardless of the file name extension.
					</p>
					<p>
For non-Maven projects, that may not define a <strong>src/test/resources</strong> directory, the test data file can be
placed under your source directory within the Java package that reflects the logical name.
The test data file must be subsequently included alongside the compiled Java class files during the build process and
thereby included in the class path for the JVM in which the tests are running.
					</p>
					<p>
Note that some IDEs including Eclipse will execute JUnit tests natively within the IDE.
The directory that comprises the test data files, such as <strong>src/test/resources</strong> for Maven projects, should
be defined as a source folder so that the IDE will include the test data files on the class path when executing JUnit.
In Eclipse you may navigate to the <strong>src/test/resources</strong> directory, visible within the
<strong>Project Explorer</strong> view, and right-click on that directory and then click
<strong>Build Path -> Use as Source Folder</strong>.
					</p>
					<h3>Test Data</h3>
					<p>
The test data file may be authored in either tab-separated or comma-separated variable format.
The example test class defined above utilises test data defined as collections where the test scenario criteria, that
will be used to invoke the component being tested, and the test scenario result, that will be matched against the actual
return value from the component being tested, are represented by a map and list respectively.
					</p>
					<p>
Dingo supports the definition of test data, comprised by test data files, as plain strings which may represent snippets
of text, signed integers and floating-point numbers, and boolean values of <strong>true</strong> or
<strong>false</strong>.
Dingo also supports the definition of test data using JSON so that lists and maps may be expressed within test data
files.
The example test class defined above utilises the test data file located at
<strong>src/test/resources/com/zavazoo/dingo/example/values.tsv</strong> which may resemble the following example:
					</p>
<pre>["value"]	{"key": "value"}
["apple", "tomato"]	{"fruit": "apple", "vegetable": "tomato"}</pre>
					<p>
Note that Dingo expects the test scenario result to be defined as the first column of any given row.
All subsequent columns are regarded as test scenario criteria.
In the example above there is only one criterion, that expresses the map passed as a parameter to the
<strong>Component.values</strong> method,  but there is no limit to the number of criteria which may be defined for any
row in a test data file.
					</p>
					<p>
Furthermore Dingo does not place any constraint on the relative number of criteria defined for any given row.
Some rows may define more criteria than others, within the same test data file, and some rows may define zero
criteria, while other rows define many criteria, but the first column of any given row must define the expected result
of the test even if the result is an empty string or some other placeholder.
					</p>
					<h3>Scenario Iteration</h3>
					<p>
Dingo provides a simple way to iterate over test scenarios;
					</p>
<pre><code>while (scenarios.more()) {

	Scenario scenario = scenarios.next();

}</code></pre>
					<p>
This <strong>more</strong> / <strong>next</strong> strategy is used, in preference to list iteration, so that Dingo can
optimise the reading and parsing of lines from the test data file.
Dingo will only perform the work involved to read and parse the next line when the <strong>scenarios.next()</strong>
method is invoked by the test class.
					</p>
					<h3>Result and Criteria</h3>
					<p>
Dingo provides two members of the <strong>Scenario</strong> class named <strong>result</strong> and
<strong>criteria</strong>.
The <strong>Scenario.result</strong> member references a Dingo <strong>Value</strong> object that represents the result
column of the current row as defined in the test data file.
The <strong>Scenario.criteria</strong> member references an array of Dingo <strong>Value</strong> objects which
represent the remaining columns of the current row used to define the criteria of the test.
					</p>
					<p>
The Dingo <strong>Value</strong> object provides a range of methods which may be called by the test class to obtain the
test data value as a wide range of different types:
					</p>
<pre><code>/**
 * Constitutes a value of some test data, providing easy access to a wide range of value types so that calling code may
 * avoid parsing string values to other types.
 */
public class Value {

	/**
	 * Yields this value as a string.
	 * 
	 * @return the string.
	 */
	public String string();

	/**
	 * Yields this value as a character.
	 * 
	 * @return the character.
	 */
	public char character();

	/**
	 * Yields this value as a boolean.
	 * 
	 * @return the boolean.
	 */
	public boolean truth();

	/**
	 * Yields this value as an integer.
	 * 
	 * @return the integer.
	 */
	public int integer();

	/**
	 * Yields this value as a short integer.
	 * 
	 * @return the short integer.
	 */
	public short shortint();

	/**
	 * Yields this value as a long integer.
	 * 
	 * @return the long integer.
	 */
	public long longint();

	/**
	 * Yields this value as a short floating-point number.
	 * 
	 * @return the short floating-point number.
	 */
	public float floating();

	/**
	 * Yields this value as a long floating-point number.
	 * 
	 * @return the long floating-point number.
	 */
	public double doubleint();

	/**
	 * Yields this value as a big decimal to help with precise calculations.
	 * 
	 * @return the big decimal.
	 */
	public BigDecimal precise();

	/**
	 * Yields this value as a list created using "raw/untyped" JSON binding.
	 * 
	 * @return the list.
	 */
	public List&lt;Object&gt; list();

	/**
	 * Yields this value as a map created using "raw/untyped" JSON binding.
	 * 
	 * @return the map.
	 */
	public Map&lt;String, Object&gt; map();

					<h2>Working Examples</h2>
					<p>
This section provides examples of various forms of test data and the commensurate test classes which could be developed
to access and utilise the test data.
					</p>
					<h3>Working with Strings</h3>
					<p>
The following test data located at the relative filesystem path
<strong>src/test/resources/com/domain/project/city-suburbs.csv</strong>
lists three suburbs of various Cities:
					</p>
<pre>London, Mayfair, Bloomsbury, Covent Garden
New York City, Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens
Paris, Neuilly-sur-Seine, Arrondissement de Passy, Île Saint-Louis</pre>
					<p>
The test data may be used to assert the validity of an hypothetical operation named
<strong>CityFinder.matchCityForSuburbs</strong> that matches and yields the name of a City given the names of three
suburbs or boroughs of that City:
					</p>
<pre><code>package com.domain.project;

import static org.hamcrest.MatcherAssert.assertThat;
import static org.hamcrest.Matchers.equalTo;

import junit.framework.TestCase;
import org.junit.Test;

import com.zavazoo.dingo.Dingo;
import com.zavazoo.dingo.Scenario;
import com.zavazoo.dingo.Scenarios;

public class CityFinderTest extends TestCase {

	@Test
	public void testMatchCityForSuburbs() {

		Scenarios scenarios = Dingo.scenarios("com/domain/project/city-suburbs");

		while (scenarios.more()) {

			Scenario scenario = scenarios.next();

			String expected = scenario.result.string();

			String firstSuburb = scenario.criteria[0].string();
			String secondSuburb = scenario.criteria[1].string();
			String thirdSuburb = scenario.criteria[2].string();

			String actual = CityFinder.matchCityForSuburbs(firstSuburb, secondSuburb, thirdSuburb);

			assertThat(actual, equalTo(expected);

		}

	}

}</code></pre>
					<h3>Working with Numbers</h3>
					<p>
The following test data located at the relative filesystem path
<strong>src/test/resources/com/domain/project/algebra.tsv</strong>
lists the variables for an equation that adds the first value to zero, then subtracts the second value, then divides by
the third value, and finally multiplies by the fourth value, assuming that the first value is always an integer but all
subsequent values may be floating-point numbers:
					</p>
<pre>0.5	4	3	2	1
-7.5	5	10	20	30
14	20	10	2.5	3.5</pre>
					<p>
The test data may be used to assert the validity of an hypothetical operation named
<strong>Equations.addSubtractDivideMultiply</strong> that performs the calculation and yields the result:
					</p>
<pre><code>package com.domain.project;

import static org.hamcrest.MatcherAssert.assertThat;
import static org.hamcrest.Matchers.equalTo;

import junit.framework.TestCase;
import org.junit.Test;

import com.zavazoo.dingo.Dingo;
import com.zavazoo.dingo.Scenario;
import com.zavazoo.dingo.Scenarios;

public class EquationsTest extends TestCase {

	@Test
	public void testAddSubtractDivideMultiply() {

		Scenarios scenarios = Dingo.scenarios("com/domain/project/algebra");

		while (scenarios.more()) {

			Scenario scenario = scenarios.next();

			BigDecimal expected = scenario.result.precise();

			int add = scenario.criteria[0].integer();
			BigDecimal subtract = scenario.criteria[1].precise();
			BigDecimal divide = scenario.criteria[2].precise();
			BigDecimal multiply = scenario.criteria[3].precise();

			BigDecimal actual = Equations.addSubtractDivideMultiply(add, subtract, divide, multiply);

			assertThat(actual, equalTo(expected);

		}

	}
